Akinyi M,This is one of the oldest hotels but its has retained its allure and beauty and service. Please don't change the management. It is within the city centre making it accessible to get to the place you need in town thats why I stay here,Positive
Ahmad Mreish,"I had bad experience last year, I had a dinner next to the pool, I still remember that day til today! The food was horrible, cold, and taste funny. We tried to change the order but it turn into the same horrible taste. We tried to talk to the chef but no luck that make us leave without eating anything.Also the service was very slow,I highly don't recommend it!",Negative

Cynthia Mumbo,"5 star beautiful place, but I was treated like trash. Concierge typical of inferiority complex came to ask me why I was at the lobby. Didn't ask anyone else ,Absolutely disgusted",Negative
Douglas M,This is a fantastic camp. Rooms are clean and large. They are very luxurious. The staff is spectacular. Everyone was accommodating and friendly. The food was tasty. The local safari just outside the camp is loaded with animals. ,Positive
muzungu57 ,"first class hotel in NairobiSerena Hotel offers everything you need! a nice garden, a heated pool, a big enough gym, a spa, several restaurants and bars and - for us most important - an excellent guest relation desk: due to Covid19, we had to take a PCR test the day before our flights. the hotel offers this service, taken at your room for USD 100, the results are printed and given to you the next morning! we asked for alternatives to a closed on Monday Sushi place, they provided us with a name, did the reservation! one of our flights had been rescheduled 6 hours later and the offered us a very late check out at 2200 for half of the room price.",Positive
wamuyu501,"RUDE STAFFIf you are kenyan and black, kindly stay away from this hotel. Suffice to stay, after a 3 day staycation I am not coming back. Don't get me wrong, the hotel has top notch service but the treatment by the staff terrible. Right from the reception you encounter rude, impressionable and impersonal staff. At the breakfast buffet two waiters were arguing rudely on whether to sit me inside or outside. I therefore had to stand for close to 5 minutes before being seated. Sometimes I would be left talking to myself as the waiters rushed to take orders from white and Indian customers. If your staff don't like blackKenyans, maybe you should",Negative
Nyawira W, walked in was to meet a business colleague and have lunch! Walked in.. sat by the pool. 15mins in no one has come to ask on what I would like. 3 more clients walked in and waiters were pretty much tail gating them I’d say.Maybe I wasn’t as ‘smart’ as the other people in suits and all?Anyway it’s a service industry. Treat all clients the same.,Negative
saltsy372 ,"Stayed here for 2 nights on arrival in Nairobi. First night was very late.Hotel is about half hour from international airport.Very comfortable rooms with all amenities.Good sized room, nicely decorated, with excellent bathroom and all facilities. everything we needed in the room.We were exhausted after the fight from Miami via London to Nairobi, so we don't remember much about the first night.Hotel and room is decked out in African colors, burnt oranges, brown, creams and golds. Room has a safe and mini bar, good storage area and nice view from the picture window.Front desk was very helpful and friendly. Security is high level. guards on gated entry and metal detectors are used. Luggage is also put through metal detectors when you enter the hotel.All the hotels have this.All in all this is a good quality hotel for a Nairobi trip, before or after safari",Positive
vikkia80,"The hotel is nice but quite outdated. Super friendly and helpful staff, who always seem happy. The breakfast was great. The room furniture is quite old, but the bed was very comfortable. This is the only hotel that I have stayed in, in Nairobi. Therefore, I cannot compare to others. The location was good and I would stay here again.",Positive
560djm ,"Serena a hotel is well situated within Nairobi,. The rooms a well maintained, clean, and extremely comfortable. The staff were very helpful and willing to make our stay enjoyable. The breakfast was good with a variety of food including delicious fresh fruit each day. As a family we really enjoyed our stay at Serena and always felt safe within the hotel compound.",Positive
Derik A ,"Tired after a long flight which came in after midnight, we were quickly registered and went to our rooms exhausted.We slept well on very comfortable beds, and encountered no major problems.Frankly we were so tired we could have slept on the floor! Next day we had an adequate breakfast, after which we explored some Nairobi sights.when we returned after a full day's sightseeing, once again off to bed.All in all, neither complaints nor medals for this Serena.",Neutral
Bruce G ,"I spent 8 days at this hotel on a business trip to Nairobi. It is not a vacation hotel with lots of resort facilities other than a good size swimming pool but for a business trip it is cool – centrally located and with ample meeting rooms.
The rooms are nice and are refreshed daily with fresh towels etc. The food in the buffet restaurant (Café Maghreb) includes local Kenyan dishes but is a bit monotonous – practically the same things every day but there is enough variety for you to pick and choose. I ordered the seafood platter a la carte which included three lobster tails. One was very good; the others were mushy, had obviously seen fresher days and should have been tossed in the waste bin – not on the grill.
I found the staff very attentive and helpful. For a business trip, I would definitely go back there in the hope that with comments like this the food offerings will get some improvement attention.",Neutral
Rits2211,"We were recommended to stay here because it was a five star hotel. Not true. Was more like a 3 1/2*. Both restaurants we ate at were very poor. Although the service was great. Three incidences happened where they gave my sister and I chilled red wines in two different sized glasses. We had to get their attention that we did not like our wine cold and please change the glass. The one restaurant we ate was so bad, we both didn’t finish our food with only one to two bites. The pork rib was so hard and chewy.

There were so many security guards on those two days we were there. It seemed like they were hawking and eagle eyeing on us.

The salon staff was very nice. Don’t mind going back to them but will not return to the hotel. There are other hotels much nicer and food better.",Neutral
PhileasFogg1965,"I stayed four nights here, in quite an expensive room, but on my arrival, straight off the plane at about 2300, the man on the desk tried to switch me to a room with twin single beds! I told him that for the money I had shelled out I expected to get the king size bed I had paid for. The rest of the staff were pleasant, and the swimming pool was great, but the food was a let-down, particularly in the evening. It was all stodgy and, in the usual African style, overcooked. I’m not saying this is a bad place, but unless you’re a fan of ubiquitous marble, it’s not five stars.",Neutral
LocalTraveller254,"We decided to have lunch at Serena on the Mashujaa day weekend after church. We had 3 kids with us. As it was a hot day, we had figured the kids could swim as we ate and from a previous visit I remembered that on Sunday there was a play area for kids if they chose not to swim.You can imagine my disappointment when we get there and there is no play area. We asked about swimming and balked at the price. I would have overlooked that if the play area was still available. We sat at the pool and as there was no other entertainment, all the kids could do was look at each other as the adults ate. Worst thing about it was, there was no lifesaver around and kids run around...what if one had fallen in? For a Sunday it used to be my go to recommendation for families.. I may have to rethink this and possibly head over to Intercontinental next time for a Sunday afternoon lunch.",Neutral
dmorr06,This is a fantastic camp. Rooms are clean and large. They are very luxurious. The staff is spectacular. Everyone was accommodating and friendly. The food was tasty. The local safari just outside the camp is loaded with animals. They are a short drive to the national park. We loved sitting on the porch with a glass of wine and watching an antelope frolicking with a pack of baboons. Do yourself a favor and book this camp!,Positive
phineas,Top of the range hotel would match anything anywhere in the world. The service and rooms were to the highest international standards. If I have 1 small quibble it would have been nice to have more local TV content,Positive
travelmadNorthampton,"We stayed at thee Serena again before our safari, we always stay at the Serena when we arrive in Nairobi as after a long flight it is so nice to have such lovely rooms with beautiful comfy beds and a massage in their fabulous spa. We came back to the Serena for a few days after our safari to relax before returning home and was initially very disappointed with our room as it faced the busy road, a visit to reception and this was sorted straight away and we were moved to a room at the rear of the hotel with no noise and we quickly settled back in. We had several visits to the fabulous spa, probably the best spa we have ever been to and we have visited many all over the world but this one bring us back to the Serena every time we visit Nairobi. We had some lovely meals and spent some time by their lovely pool which is as warm a bath! We enjoyed our stay here very much and no doubt when we come back to Nairobi which I am sure we will we will return to this beautiful hotel.",Positive
